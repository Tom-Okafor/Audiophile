# My First Tailwind Project

In this mini project, I will be using Tailwind css for the first time to build a landing page. Some of the features I hope to implement include:

- paddings
- colors
- font size
- responsiveness
- transitions
- sizing

and much more.

I am so excited to delve into the world of the highly renowned and most-esteemed Tailwind!!

Yay!! I guess, LOL...
